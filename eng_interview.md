Hi there, how are you today?

I have been living in Yerevan and Tbilisi since September 2022.
My current company is WeareVolt. I started to work for this company approximately 8 months ago.

The main line of business is copyright. I'm working on a product that helps bills people for using songs on platforms.

Until this I worked at Quantori. The company specializes in the LifeScience and HealthСare business area.

During my time at Quantori, I had about 10 projects. Most of the projects were related to containerization. During my time at Quantori, I gained experience working with clouds such as Azure and AWS. I gain strong background in kubernetes, terraform. Regarding CI/CD, I have worked with Azure devops, Gitlab and a little jenkins. Regarding to Infrastructure As a Code approach, most of the time I worked with Terraform cause it is the most suitable tool for clouds. Also used ansible but know it less.
Among monitoring systems, I worked with Datadog, Prometeus, Azure monitor.




Let me try to tell you about the most interesting project from the DevOps point of view.
 The project began with the NPM package for customers' frontend . A few months later our sales prolong the contract and we began to develop the backend part and provide it as 2 helm charts.
Our customers were so impressed with the success of the product inside the company that they decided to sell it to the external market and we began to do the desktop.
So, let`s summarize: from one source code, we built and deployed to k8s frontend, backend parts and also provide desktop applications (I mean msi and dmg installers)

Hard link vs soft link
A hard link is a file all its own, and the file references or points to the exact spot on a hard drive where the Inode stores the data.
A soft link isn't a separate file, it points to the name of the original file, rather than to a spot on the hard drive.

An inode, or index descriptor, is a data structure that stores meta-information about standard files, directories, or other file system objects other than the actual data and name.

Process states:

What is a zombie process?
In Linux (and other Unix-like operating systems),
a zombie process is a process that has terminated but still has an entry in the process table. This happens when a process terminates but its parent process has not called the wait() system call to obtain the child process's exit code.

Basic system calls:
- open - open a file
- read - attempts to read from a file descriptor
- write - attempts to write to a file descriptor
- close - closes a file after reading or writing
- fork - creates a new child process
- execve - executes an executable file

There are 7 different runlevels (runlevel 0-6) in Linux system for different purposes:

0: Halt System (To shutdown the system)
1: Single user mode
2: Basic multi user mode without NFS
3: Full multi user mode (text based)
4: unused
5: Multi user mode with Graphical User Interface
6: Reboot System

TOP command
RES (Resident Set Size): This is the amount of physical memory (RAM) currently in use by the process. Includes: Current shared libraries, as well as physical memory currently occupied by the process.

VIRT (Virtual Memory Size): What it shows: This is the total amount of virtual memory used by the process. Includes: All code, data, and shared libraries, as well as memory allocated but not used (i.e. not loaded into RAM).

OMM killer is a Linux kernel defense mechanism designed to solve memory shortage problems. When available memory is exhausted, it forcibly "kills" the most suitable process by sending it a KILL signal

Garbage collector is one of the forms of automatic memory management. A special process, called a garbage collector, periodically frees memory by removing objects that have become unnecessary.

Load avarage
Load average is a metric used to display the average load on a system over a given period of time. It indicates the number of active processes that are either running or waiting to run on the processor.
